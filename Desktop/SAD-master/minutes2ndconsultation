bakit may FK ng accounts yung mga tables?
kasi siya na bahala

Ano hinahandle ni accnt manager?
you don't need to add the FK? We still need to add it

REMOVE the "handled by"

you should have a text file wherein dun na siya mag-aadd and not sa database
pwede naman both
but if you're going to put it in the database, it's a floating table (you don't need to connect it to any table)
